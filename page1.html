  <p class="smallsize"> The thought process of this website was pretty easy, the wireframe this was very similar to the one i made for my wireframe assignment. Since the whole purpose of this website is to showcase my java script and css skills, I needed a nice looking website that would be easy to code. I decided to make the website into 4 parts, the header, navigation, body and footer. I used a  I made all the different components of my website all rectangular shaped boxes stacked vertically within a good proximity of one another. Now that my website frame was completed, i began working on all the components of my page except the main body.  Combining this with different colours and contrasts for the boxes helped add contrast as well. I picked teal as my main color colour for my website, and got different shades of it using the colour wheel.  Other than teal, I also incorporated black and white into my website design to give it some contrast and make it look nice.   I wanted a custom image for the banner of the website, so I made the header almost as big as the body. This is consistent on every page, the banner uses colours that are found throughout my website and displays them in a gradient, it helps tie in the foreground with the background colors of my website and doing so once again helps add the effect contrast. The other color I decided to incorporate in my design was a red, the opposite of teal that my entire website is wearing. This is used for my website title and headings, because it's the opposite color it stands out perfectly as a secondary font. Under my banner I decided to include a horizontal navigation bar, since I had used a plain white background, I made my navigation bar black to add contrast, and add a form of repetition.  I used sans-serif text on my navigation panel to give it a modern look,  and aligned the different page links within good proximity of each other.  The footer of my body uses a dark teal colour that is repeated throughout my entire website design, and the text is the same white found in my background and banner, this once again adds contrast and shows repetition in my design.  After i had finished designing everything, I made the main body a neutral colour that goes with both dark and white font. I left this area blank as it would be the only area for me to show my java script and css abilities.  This is the only part of my website is different between every webpage. To make my job easier, I decided I would only use red font on some of my text on the main body to tie it in with the red on the banner of my website. And that was my thought process for this website idea.
